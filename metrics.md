The A/B Testing Process
The correct way to run an AB testing experiment (or any other experiment for that matter) is to follow the Scientific Method. The steps of the Scientific Method are:
1. Ask a question: "Why is the bounce rate of my website higher than industry standard?"
2. Do background research: Understand your visitors' behavior using Google Analytics and any other analytics tools running on your website.
3. Construct a hypothesis: "Adding more links in the footer will reduce the bounce rate".
4. Calculate the number of visitors/days you need to run the test for:Always calculate the number of visitors required for a test before starting the test. You can use our A/B Test Duration Calculator.
5. Test your hypothesis: You create a site wide A/B test in which the variation (version B) has a footer with more links. You test it against the original and measure bounce rate.
6. Analyze data and draw conclusions: If the footer with more links reduces bounce rate, then you can conclude that increased number of links in the footer is one of the factors that reduces bounce. If there is no difference in bounce, then go back to step 3 and construct a new hypothesis.
7. Report results to all concerned: Let others in Marketing, IT and UI/UX know of the test results and insights generated.

What to measeure
Metrics should be driven by questions or purpose
Measure against yourseflt
Measurements make your decisions better (but only if we are measuring the right things)
Monitor → if it affects bussiness value someone should be woken up


Shorter decision making cycle: observe / orient / dicide (meaningfully) / act (ooda loop)
Observer: what is 99% latancy of autocomplete cycle – 500ms
Orient: is it ok? It was 50ms last night → way slower
Decide: should we add new feature or make it faster → make it faster
Act → write a code
If we iterate faster we will win:
→ fewer bugs (we will know about the faster)
→ more features (you will not on features which don't matter)
→ happier users → more money

Make better decisions by using number

how do metrics do map to business goals?

Did we break something?
Do we have any problems?
Do users need this feature?

What do we measure
Server metrics:
page load time
disk io / cpu / network

Eropic.crawlers:
page_load – request to source sites
albums consumes

eropic.ms
albums porcessed by status

erovideo.crawlers
page_load
movies crawled
movies downloaded

punyu.ms
images processed
videos processed

vs
last crawled album date by site
last crawled Japanese album date by site
total japanese movies crawled for last 24 hours
crawled dvds count




Problems:
1. Hard to measure
2. What to measure? We don't know
3. How to review the results? Are we good or not?

Solve:
architecture → easy way to add new metrics
